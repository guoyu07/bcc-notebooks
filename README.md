## Overview

This repo is a collection of my BCC/eBPF related notebooks:

* [bcc-dev-tutorial.ipynb](bcc-dev-tutorial.ipynb): a WIP notebook adaption of the [bcc developer tutorial](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/tutorial_bcc_python_developer.md).


## Up and Running

A Vagrant file is included which can spin up a test machine in VirtualBox that includes bcc and Jupyter. If you have Vagrant installed then the following command should be enough to get a Jupyter notebook server up and running and try these notebooks:

```
make up
```
